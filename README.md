# Page-Turner

An ASP.NET MVC web application for an online bookstore, enabling administrators to manage book inventory and users to browse and purchase books, with secure authentication using ASP.NET Identity.

## Overview

Page-Turner is a full-stack web application designed for a specific bookstore to manage its online catalog and sales. Administrators can add, edit, and delete books, while registered users can browse and purchase books. The application uses ASP.NET MVC for the back-end, ASP.NET Identity for authentication and role-based authorization, and a responsive front-end built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This project showcases skills in C#, MVC architecture, and database management with SQL Server.
